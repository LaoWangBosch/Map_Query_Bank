<p>
Visual-based high-definition (HD) map detection has become a crucial component of map-free autonomous driving systems. The most effective solutions currently utilize a query-based Bird-eye View (BEV) Transformer model. During the training phase, not only the model parameters are optimized, but also a map query embedding is optimized to learn the HD map distribution of the training data. However, this learned query embedding can not generalize well to any new data domain out of training distribution. To achieve a general HD map detection, this paper introduces the concept of standard-definition (SD) map prior distribution. SD map prior can help to build a general and domain-free map distribution with the proposed map query bank.

To effectively incorporate the SD map prior, we explore the properties of SD map data and the representation of map queries. Finally, a new rule-based post-processing module is proposed to provide more reliable results by combining it with data-based model. Extensive experiments demonstrate that our proposed method enhances both the accuracy and efficiency of HD map detection by generalizing the map distribution using the SD map prior.

## extended and manual labeled SDMap subset for OpenLaneV2 dataset 

Through meticulous investigation, we have identified three primary issues within the 850 training and validation scenes provided by OpenLaneV2 regarding the SDMap.

First, there is a significant false negative (FN) problem arising from the low coverage of ground truth high-definition maps. Specifically, certain roads in the real world, such as Road A, are present in the navigation maps but lack corresponding information in the high-definition maps. This discrepancy can lead to incomplete navigational guidance and potential navigation errors.

Second, false positives (FP) occur due to updates in the navigation maps. For instance, Road A may exist in the high-definition map, but changes in the real world render it untraceable in the SDMap, thus creating inconsistencies between the maps and potentially misleading users.

Finally, the absence of human verification in crowd-sourced open navigation maps results in semantic information loss and inaccuracies. Common issues include discrepancies in lane counts, where the number provided in the navigation map does not align with reality, or even the complete omission of lane information. Addressing these challenges is essential for improving the reliability and usability of navigation systems.  Pls refer to Fig. XXX

To address these issues, we have meticulously designed an SD map verification and correction toolchain. This toolchain enables us to perform a semi-automated comparison between the ground truth high-definition maps and the SD map, allowing for systematic correction of SD map errors on a scene-by-scene basis. By facilitating this process, we aim to enhance the accuracy and reliability of navigation maps, ultimately improving user experience and operational effectiveness.
